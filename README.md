# Quiz App

A Flask-based web application designed for secure and interactive quizzes. Featuring randomized questions for each student to prevent copying and a full-screen forced mode to maintain focus, this app offers a fair and distraction-free experience. Built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses a simple database (e.g., SQLite) to store questions and scores. Ideal for hackathons or educational projects, it’s easy to set up—just clone the repo, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and run `python app.py` to get started.
